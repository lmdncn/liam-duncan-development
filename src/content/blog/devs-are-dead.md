# Devs Are Dead: My Rebirth as an AI Agent Manager

Like many developers, my AI journey started with **GitHub Copilot**. Inside VS Code, it felt like autocomplete on steroids. Later, moving to **Cursor** gave me a smoother UI and better ways to pass context. But the tools had limits. Without carefully feeding them instruction files and file context, they struggled to truly understand the systems I was working on. Helpful, yes, but transformative? Not yet.

Then I took a step back. On summer vacation in the French Riviera, I had time to reflect: why was I hesitant? Why were so many of us biased against letting AI take the driver’s seat? It reminded me of the industrial robotics revolution, when workers stopped assembling every piece by hand and instead learned to manage the machines that did it faster, more efficiently, and at greater scale. New skills became essential: communication, management, organization, systems thinking. Old skills weren’t irrelevant, but their value shifted.

The same thing is happening in software engineering.

When I came back, I dove in. No boardrooms, no whiteboards. I’d walk and talk with ChatGPT, and a few kilometers later I had a PRD. Back at my desk, I’d work with AI to break the PRD into domains, generate architecture diagrams, and even draft wireframes. With tools like **Lovable**, I could spin up prototypes, click around, note my thoughts, and improve them on the fly.

Then came **Claude Code**, and that changed everything. I could turn markdown plans into scaffolding for entire systems, split projects into modular parts, and spin up multiple Git worktrees. It felt like managing a team of agents, each working in parallel. What once took a squad of engineers could now be orchestrated by one.

That’s when it hit me: I wasn’t just coding anymore. **I was managing AI agents.**

And the shift goes even further. Developers like me are becoming builders, product managers, and product owners, guiding AI through vision, structure, and decisions. Meanwhile, product managers are turning into developers, able to spin up prototypes and ship features themselves with AI support. Even people without a computer science degree like mine are now building sophisticated, technical applications that would have once required a specialized team.

The lines are blurring. What used to be siloed roles are converging into one: the ability to harness AI effectively.

And this shift isn’t trivial. Coding knowledge is becoming less valuable on its own. What’s rising in importance are the skills to communicate clearly, make decisions quickly, organize complexity, and explain ideas effectively. The role of the engineer is being redefined.

I’ve spent the last decade of my life sharpening coding skills, so I don’t say this lightly. But the truth is: the world has changed. The developer, as we knew it, is gone. The future belongs to the **AI Agent Manager**.
