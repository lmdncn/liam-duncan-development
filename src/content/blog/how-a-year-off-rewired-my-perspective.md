After six years of working as a software engineer and tech lead, I hit pause. Not because I was burned out. Not because I hated my work. I just wanted perspective. I’d always dreamed of traveling the world, and last year I finally took the leap. A year-long career break across four continents and more than 15 countries.

Here’s what I realized. Over years of work, you get wired a certain way. Routines, systems, and habits make you efficient, but they also make you rigid. Sometimes, to really grow, you have to cut those wires and allow yourself to be rewired.

Travel did that for me. It broke patterns I didn’t even know I was stuck in. I saw how differently people live and think, and learned you don’t need to understand everyone. You just need to listen.

Some moments hit harder than others. Standing beneath the Great Pyramids in Giza or wandering through Angkor Wat, I felt small. People have always achieved incredible things. We talk about technology moving faster than ever, but I’m sure they felt the same back then. It’s all perspective. The broader your horizons, the more you see how much is always in motion.

And when I came back, the timing could not have been crazier. Right in the middle of AI’s explosion. But instead of being overwhelmed, I felt clear. Like wiping a hard drive before a fresh install, I was ready to load new ideas without the clutter of old biases. Taking a break didn’t set me back. It rewired me to move forward faster.

If you have ever thought about stepping away, I can’t recommend it enough. The world keeps moving whether you are in the race or not. Sometimes the best way to catch up is to stop running.
