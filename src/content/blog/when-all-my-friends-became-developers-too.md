Over the past year, a wave of friends has reached out to me for help on their projects. Not friends from engineering school. Not people who spent years debugging APIs or designing systems. These are friends from business, design, and completely different worlds. And here’s the wild part: they’re building apps.  

Not just drag-and-drop Wix sites. Full systems with databases, API integrations, and features I used to think of as “real engineering.” They’re wiring things together, solving problems, and launching products with tools I never imagined they’d use.  

The reason is simple: AI lowered the barrier. What once took months of learning now takes a few weekends and the right prompts. AI doesn’t just autocomplete code. It explains errors, generates schemas, and connects pieces in a way that used to demand years of experience.  

But there’s a catch. Eventually, they hit a wall. The AI builds faster than their understanding can keep up. Suddenly, the app feels bigger than them. They get lost in the sauce. When something breaks or an early decision creates problems, they don’t know how to guide the AI toward a fix, because they don’t fully understand the architecture underneath.  

That’s where I step in. When a friend calls, it’s not just about solving a bug. It’s about giving them just enough context so they can reason through the problem and steer the AI toward a solution, without needing the full weight of engineering school in their heads. Striking that balance has been eye-opening.  

At first, I wasn’t sure how to feel. I’ve spent years building scalable systems and leading teams through messy technical challenges. Part of me wondered if my craft was being diluted. But the more I watch, the more I see this shift as exciting.  

Because it’s not about everyone becoming an engineer. It’s about more people being able to ship ideas. Some projects will outgrow no-code or AI-assisted beginnings, and that’s when experience still matters. But the fact that my friends can now move from idea to product without the old hurdles, that’s powerful.  

It’s made me rethink my role. Maybe being an engineer today isn’t only about writing optimized code. Maybe it’s also about being a guide, a partner, and sometimes a translator between people’s ideas and the systems that bring them to life. That feels like a future worth leaning into.
