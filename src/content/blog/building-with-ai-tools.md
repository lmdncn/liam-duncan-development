# Building Scalable Applications with AI Tools

The landscape of software development has been transformed by AI-powered tools. Over the past year, I've integrated various AI assistants into my workflow, and the productivity gains have been remarkable.

## The Game Changers

### Claude Code
Claude Code has revolutionized how I approach complex refactoring tasks. The ability to understand entire codebases and suggest architectural improvements has saved countless hours of manual analysis.

### GitHub Copilot
For day-to-day coding, Copilot excels at:
- Autocompleting repetitive patterns
- Writing boilerplate code
- Suggesting edge case handling

## Real-World Impact

At my recent role, I used these tools to:
- Migrate a Django API to a more modular architecture
- Build automated data pipelines with proper error handling
- Optimize database queries that improved response times by 50%

## Best Practices

1. **Don't blindly accept suggestions** - Always review and understand the code
2. **Use AI for exploration** - Great for discovering new patterns and approaches
3. **Maintain code quality standards** - AI-generated code still needs proper testing

## The Future

As these tools continue improving, I see them becoming essential for:
- Rapid prototyping
- Legacy code modernization  
- Complex debugging sessions

The key is learning to work *with* AI, not replacing human judgment but augmenting it.
