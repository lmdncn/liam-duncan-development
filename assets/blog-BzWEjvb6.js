Like many developers, my AI journey started with GitHub Copilot. Inside VS Code, it felt like autocomplete on steroids. Later, moving to Cursor gave me a smoother UI and better ways to pass context. But the tools had limits. Without carefully feeding them instruction files and file context, they struggled to truly understand the systems I was working on. Helpful, yes, but transformative? Not yet.

Then I took a step back. On summer vacation in the French Riviera, I had time to reflect: why was I hesitant? Why were so many of us biased against letting AI take the driver’s seat? It reminded me of the industrial robotics revolution, when workers stopped assembling every piece by hand and instead learned to manage the machines that did it faster, more efficiently, and at greater scale. New skills became essential: communication, management, organization, systems thinking. Old skills weren’t irrelevant, but their value shifted.

The same thing is happening in software engineering.

When I came back, I dove in. No boardrooms, no whiteboards. I'd walk and talk with ChatGPT, and a few kilometers later I had a PRD. Back at my desk, I'd work with AI to break the PRD into domains, generate architecture diagrams, and even draft wireframes. With tools like Lovable, I could spin up prototypes, click around, note my thoughts, and improve them on the fly.

Then came Claude Code, and that changed everything. I could turn markdown plans into scaffolding for entire systems, split projects into modular parts, and spin up multiple Git worktrees. It felt like managing a team of agents, each working in parallel. What once took a squad of engineers could now be orchestrated by one.

That's when it hit me: I wasn't just coding anymore. I was managing AI agents.

And the shift goes even further. Developers like me are becoming builders, product managers, and product owners, guiding AI through vision, structure, and decisions. Meanwhile, product managers are turning into developers, able to spin up prototypes and ship features themselves with AI support. Even people without a computer science degree like mine are now building sophisticated, technical applications that would have once required a specialized team.

The lines are blurring. What used to be siloed roles are converging into one: the ability to harness AI effectively.

And this shift isn’t trivial. Coding knowledge is becoming less valuable on its own. What’s rising in importance are the skills to communicate clearly, make decisions quickly, organize complexity, and explain ideas effectively. The role of the engineer is being redefined.

I've spent the last decade of my life sharpening coding skills, so I don't say this lightly. But the truth is: the world has changed. The developer, as we knew it, is gone. The future belongs to the AI Agent Manager.

title: "How a Year Off Rewired My Perspective"

After six years of working as a software engineer and tech lead, I hit pause. Not because I was burned out. Not because I hated my work. I just wanted perspective. I’d always dreamed of traveling the world, and last year I finally took the leap. A year-long career break across four continents and more than 15 countries.

Here’s what I realized. Over years of work, you get wired a certain way. Routines, systems, and habits make you efficient, but they also make you rigid. Sometimes, to really grow, you have to cut those wires and allow yourself to be rewired.

Travel did that for me. It broke patterns I didn’t even know I was stuck in. I saw how differently people live and think, and learned you don’t need to understand everyone. You just need to listen.

Some moments hit harder than others. Standing beneath the Great Pyramids in Giza or wandering through Angkor Wat, I felt small. People have always achieved incredible things. We talk about technology moving faster than ever, but I’m sure they felt the same back then. It’s all perspective. The broader your horizons, the more you see how much is always in motion.

And when I came back, the timing could not have been crazier. Right in the middle of AI’s explosion. But instead of being overwhelmed, I felt clear. Like wiping a hard drive before a fresh install, I was ready to load new ideas without the clutter of old biases. Taking a break didn’t set me back. It rewired me to move forward faster.

If you have ever thought about stepping away, I can’t recommend it enough. The world keeps moving whether you are in the race or not. Sometimes the best way to catch up is to stop running.

title: "When All My Friends Became Developers Too"

excerpt: "AI has lowered the barrier to software, letting friends from completely different worlds build apps. But when they get lost in the sauce, that’s where engineering experience still matters."

Over the past year, a wave of friends has reached out to me for help on their projects. Not friends from engineering school. Not people who spent years debugging APIs or designing systems. These are friends from business, design, and completely different worlds. And here’s the wild part: they’re building apps.  

Not just drag-and-drop Wix sites. Full systems with databases, API integrations, and features I used to think of as “real engineering.” They’re wiring things together, solving problems, and launching products with tools I never imagined they’d use.  

The reason is simple: AI lowered the barrier. What once took months of learning now takes a few weekends and the right prompts. AI doesn’t just autocomplete code. It explains errors, generates schemas, and connects pieces in a way that used to demand years of experience.  

But there’s a catch. Eventually, they hit a wall. The AI builds faster than their understanding can keep up. Suddenly, the app feels bigger than them. They get lost in the sauce. When something breaks or an early decision creates problems, they don’t know how to guide the AI toward a fix, because they don’t fully understand the architecture underneath.  

That’s where I step in. When a friend calls, it’s not just about solving a bug. It’s about giving them just enough context so they can reason through the problem and steer the AI toward a solution, without needing the full weight of engineering school in their heads. Striking that balance has been eye-opening.  

At first, I wasn’t sure how to feel. I’ve spent years building scalable systems and leading teams through messy technical challenges. Part of me wondered if my craft was being diluted. But the more I watch, the more I see this shift as exciting.  

Because it’s not about everyone becoming an engineer. It’s about more people being able to ship ideas. Some projects will outgrow no-code or AI-assisted beginnings, and that’s when experience still matters. But the fact that my friends can now move from idea to product without the old hurdles, that’s powerful.  

It’s made me rethink my role. Maybe being an engineer today isn’t only about writing optimized code. Maybe it’s also about being a guide, a partner, and sometimes a translator between people’s ideas and the systems that bring them to life. That feels like a future worth leaning into.
